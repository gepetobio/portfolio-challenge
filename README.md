# Portfolio Challenge

This is a mock project, like the one I used to send to applicants at a company I used to work for. I was responsible for judging the Frontend Developer applicants and I would send this challenge and see the results.

## Goals

These are some goals I want to achieve with this project:

1. to show entry level **Frontend Developers** that â€“ yes â€“ there are still some companies and managers that do think it's enough to know HTML, CSS and some JavaScript for some positions.
2. to provide a "real" project that an agency, for instance, would send to possible candidates. This should serve as a mock test, with real rules.
3. to allow peer feedback once Pull Requests (PRs) are made. _OBS: I'll try my best to review each PR, considering their numbers are reasonable._
4. to serve as a portfolio project. You invest time doing this challenge, you learn from it, you receive some feedback and you end up with another project on your portfolio ðŸ˜‰

## Challenge types

For real, I would expect a Junior Frontend Developer to build this page in about 5 days (around 40h) of work, if it were a full time job. But I understand some of you will have other day jobs, school, uni, kids, a life to deal with. And thinking of that, I created these 3 types of challenge for you to pick:

### 5 days

You've got 5 days to build this. So, let's say you've got this on Monday morning, I expect the PR and a link to the website on Friday, 5:30pm. You can start any day of the week, at any time. Just [track your time](#track-your-time) and export the timesheets to a pdf and put it on the repository.

This challenge type is advised to those who don't have a full time job and are dedicating this time of their lives to learn how to code and preparing for job interviews. This is the closest to a real case scenario at an agency so choose this one if you really want the 'real' experience. You shouldn't work more than 7,5h a day on this challenge type.

### 40 hours

You want to do the challenge but you can't be sure you can get it done in 5 days or less. Just [track your time](#track-your-time) and export the timesheets to a pdf and put it on the repository. It should show up to 40h working on the project.

This challenge type is advised to those with a busy life (another full time job, studies, kids etc.). Try to get at least 3h a day on this challenge otherwise you'll lose interest and not finish the job.

### No time limit

You are just starting and you think you can't do it in 5 days or 40h. Or you started the challenge in one of the other types but something came up (life is hard, trust me, I get it) and you exploded the deadline. Fair enough, the important thing is to finish the job (the challenge, in this case), no matter what.

## Rules

- **NO FRAMEWORKS ALLOWED!** so, forget about Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma, React, Vue, Angular or whatever framework you are used to use for your projects. I want to see good old HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- I expect a Pull Request (PR) to this repository with your version of the build and a link to where you deployed the website.
- You've got 5 days (up to 40 hours in total) to build this. So, let's say you've got this on Monday morning, I expect the PR and link on Friday, 5:30pm for my review. Branch out this repo, make the PR with an empty the day you want to start this challenge and leave a comment there

## Track your time

No matter what [challenge type](#challenge-types) you choose, you should track your time. This is the only way to see how long it takes you to build this project and will give you an idea if it's taking you too long to get it done. It will also help you estimate other future projects.

Just track your time using a tool like [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com/https://www.toggl.com/?utm_source=gledsleymuller-portfoliochallenge&utm_medium=github&utm_term=referral) and export the timesheets to a pdf and put it on the repository.

## What I will check

- Semantics HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- git
- Attention to detail (because people love to write this on their CVS)
- Reading and interpretation skills
- Browser testing
